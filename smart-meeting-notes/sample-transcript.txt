Marketing Team Meeting - Q1 Campaign Planning
Date: February 16, 2026

Attendees: Sarah (Marketing Manager), John (Content Lead), Emily (Designer), Mike (Analytics)

Sarah: Thanks everyone for joining. Let's discuss our Q1 campaign strategy. John, can you start with content plans?

John: Sure. We're planning to launch a blog series on industry trends, targeting 2 posts per week. I'll need Emily's help with featured images by next Friday. We should also revamp our email newsletter template.

Emily: I can definitely help with the blog images. For the newsletter, I'm thinking a more modern, minimalist design. I'll have mockups ready by Wednesday.

Sarah: Great. Mike, what are we seeing in terms of current engagement?

Mike: Our social media engagement is up 15% from last quarter, but website traffic is flat. I recommend we invest more in SEO and maybe run some targeted ads. I'll prepare a detailed analytics report by end of week.

Sarah: Good idea. Let's allocate $5,000 for the ad campaign. John, can you coordinate with Mike on keyword research?

John: Absolutely. Mike and I will meet tomorrow to align on keywords and content topics.

Emily: One more thing - should we update our brand guidelines? Some of our visuals feel outdated.

Sarah: Yes, let's schedule a separate meeting for that next week. I'll send out a calendar invite.

Mike: Before we wrap up, we need to decide on our primary KPIs for this quarter.

Sarah: Let's focus on three: website traffic growth, lead generation, and social engagement. Mike, can you set up a dashboard to track these?

Mike: Will do. I'll have it ready by Monday.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's reconvene in two weeks to review progress. Thanks everyone!
